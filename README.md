# Tic Tac Zwö - Educational German Language Game

This is a full-stack Flutter application (Android & iOS) designed to help German learners master noun articles (Der, Die, Das) by embedding the learning mechanic into a classic game of Tic Tac Toe.

This project was built from scratch and managed from initial concept to a 14-day closed test with live users.
